Section: B06 Hardware Acceleration of ML Algorithms
Mentor: Rajesh Gupta

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic is hardware acceleration as a whole. 
We learned the basics about application acceleration (measured through latency and throughput) and aspects of the hardware that we can change to improve the performance.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

We will start changing different simulation parameters to see how it affects the applicatio performance.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would spend more time in the beginning of the quarter on getting to learn the basics.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I look forward to working with my group on Overleaf.
